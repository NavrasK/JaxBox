# Jax In A Box

This program is designed to allow people to play games together via a desktop and mobile (to be implemented) client.

The current objective is to be able to emulate the board game "Things in a Box" where a prompt is given, then all players write an anonymous response to the prompt, and then each player takes a turn trying to match the responses to the player, scoring points for correct guesses and being eliminated if guessed.  

It is being designed with Meteor and AngularJS.
